# MNIST_Dataset_Neural_Network_Model
This is the first Deep Learning Model I have made only by following the Documentation of Tensorflow and Keras (I did not refer to any YouTube tutorials).
I made a Neural Network using Keras which trains on the MNIST Handwritten Digits Dataset and predicts the Digit in the 28X28 picture.
I achieved an accuray of 87.19% on the Test Dataset.
